# Mini projects using HTML, CSS and javascript
Welcome to my collection of **mini JavaScript projects**! 🌸  

This repository is a part of my **frontend development learning journey**, where I build **mini projects** to strengthen my **logic-building**, **problem-solving**, and **JavaScript fundamentals**.  

---

## 💡 Purpose  
I created this repo to:  
- Practice core **JavaScript concepts** like conditionals, loops, and functions  
- Understand **DOM manipulation** and user interaction  
- Convert theory into **hands-on experience**  
- Build confidence before moving on to larger React projects  

---

## 🧠 What I’ll Be Building  
Each project will be focused on one or more core JS topics, such as:  
- Conditionals & Loops  
- Arrays & Objects  
- Functions & Events  
- DOM Manipulation  
- Local Storage  
- Basic API Integration  

Every mini project will be simple but will help me **think logically and code better**.

## 🪴 My Learning Approach  
 “I believe the best way to learn JavaScript is by building.”  

So, I’ll be creating one small project at a time — starting from basics and gradually increasing complexity.  
Each project will include:  
- A short description  
- The main concept it covers  
- What I learned from it  

---

## 📈 Goals  
- Strengthen my JavaScript foundations  
- Improve coding logic and debugging skills  
- Prepare for frontend interviews  
- Build a strong base for React.js development

## 💬 Feedback  
I’m learning and growing — any feedback or suggestions are always welcome! 🌼  
If you notice any improvement areas or have project ideas, feel free to share.
